# steps

1. get a tab-separated spreadsheet with columns: name, email, zip, phone, volunteer (0/1), affiliation
2. put lines like "SOURCE=your-source-code" every time you want the source code changed
3. copy each line one at a time into Action Network
    * try the activist search page
    * if activist, edit them, otherwise make a new one
    * paste the same line into the new/edit activist page and it will prepopulate fields
    * add the volunteer tag if you see the volunteer mark
    * save and you're done
